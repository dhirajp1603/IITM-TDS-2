# Analysis Report

### Data Analysis Report Insights

This report analyzes the dataset that captures various socio-economic and psychological indicators across countries over the years. The analysis focuses on providing actionable insights, recommended visualizations, and predictive modeling suggestions based on the dataset's structure and contents.

#### Key Findings and Insights

1. **Trends Over Years**:
   - The average **Life Ladder** score is approximately 5.53, suggesting a moderate level of subjective well-being among respondents.
   - A notable correlation exists between **Log GDP per capita** and **Life Ladder** (0.76), indicating that higher economic output per individual tends to align with greater life satisfaction.

2. **Social Indicators**:
   - **Social support** shows a strong positive correlation with the **Life Ladder** (0.78), emphasizing that individuals with strong social networks tend to report higher life satisfaction.
   - The **Freedom to make life choices** (0.57) also correlates with life satisfaction, suggesting policy implications for enhancing individual liberties.

3. **Corruption and Affect**:
   - There is a significant negative correlation between **Perceptions of corruption** and **Life Ladder** (-0.47). Countries with lower perceived corruption levels tend to have higher life satisfaction.
   - **Positive affect** has a correlation of 0.65 with the **Life Ladder**, further supporting the connection between emotional well-being and life satisfaction indicators.

4. **Negative Affect**:
   - Conversely, **Negative affect** shows a strong negative correlation (-0.40) with the **Life Ladder**. Programs aimed at mental health could significantly improve quality of life.

5. **Effects of Healthy Life Expectancy**:
   - The correlation of **Healthy life expectancy at birth** with **Life Ladder** (0.72) suggests that health improvements can lead to increased life satisfaction.

6. **Missing Data**:
   - A notable number of entries have missing values, particularly in **Generosity** (28), **Perceptions of corruption** (38), and **Healthy life expectancy at birth** (13), which can impact analysis accuracy.

#### Recommended Visualizations

1. **Time Series Analysis**:
   - Plot the average **Life Ladder** score over the years to observe trends and deviations.
   - Heatmaps can visualize correlations among various indicators, highlighting strengths and weaknesses.

2. **Scatter Plots**:
   - Scatter plots can illustrate relationships between **Log GDP per capita** and **Life Ladder**, **Social support** against **Negative affect**, and other pairings based on correlation strengths.
   - Box plots to examine the distribution of **Life Ladder** scores by each country.

3. **Bar Graphs**:
   - Bar graphs to compare average indicators (e.g., **Log GDP per capita**, **Social support**) for countries that rank high and low on the **Life Ladder**.

4. **Correlation Matrix**:
   - A graphical representation (like a heatmap) of the correlation matrix to quickly identify strong relationships among indicators.

#### Suggested Predictive Modeling Techniques

1. **Linear Regression**:
   - Model life satisfaction (Life Ladder) as the dependent variable, using socio-economic indicators (e.g., GDP, social support, freedom) as independent variables.

2. **Decision Tree Regressors**:
   - Given potential non-linear relationships, decision trees can help capture complex interactions among variables, with potential pruning to avoid overfitting.

3. **Random Forest for Feature Importance**:
   - Use feature importance from a Random Forest model to determine which variables significantly impact life satisfaction.

4. **Missing Value Handling**:
   - Implement techniques like k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) or Multiple Imputation to handle missing data for more robust analyses.

5. **Outlier Detection**:
   - Utilize statistical methods (Z-score, IQR) or visualization (box plots) to identify and appropriately handle outliers, either through capping or exclusion, to ensure model accuracy.

#### Handling Missing Data and Outliers

1. **Imputation Techniques**:
   - **Mean/Median Imputation**: For numerical data, replacing missing values with the mean or median can maintain data integrity.
   - **KNN Imputation**: This method uses information from nearby data points to estimate missing values more accurately.

2. **Outlier Treatment**:
   - Winsorizing (capping extreme values) can minimize the influence of outliers on the model.
   - Transforming variables using logarithmic or box-cox transformations can help handle skewness due to extreme values.

3. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Removing rows with significant missing data or employing techniques to aggregate data for a broader aggregation could provide better insights.

In summary, the dataset provides rich opportunities for analysis to optimize social policies and improve overall life satisfaction across different countries through the identified measures. The recommendations provided will allow for further exploration and the development of predictive models that can inform and influence decision-makers effectively.
